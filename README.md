# Dartmouth Psychology Research

This website is a component of a user study being conducted by researchers in
the Dartmouth Psychology department. It mocks certain features of sites like
Airbnb, allowing users to review listings, select 5 of their favorite, and
then input responses to a series of questions.

Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
Then run 'npm start' to launch the dev site.
